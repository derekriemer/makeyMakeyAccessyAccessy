Accessibility for your makeymakey.

## Tests

This folder has a page to get makeyMakey test scripts.

1. Open the makeyMakey.htm.
2. Make sure focus is on the button, by pressing tab/shift+tab to get to the button.
3. Connect a key on the makeyMakey and note the number that pops up.

This number is important for javascripts representation of the keys on the makeyMakey.

## Tutorial.

The tutorial page is *under active development.* To use it, just open makeyMakey.htm.

The code is mainly in keys.js, and the html markup is mainly in makeyMakey.htm. Feel free to add to it *IN A SEPERATE BRANCH* Let me know when changes are made, so I can merge them with the live tutorial on the web (url)[url needs to go here.]
